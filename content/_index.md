After some hands-on experience I decided that I stick with the [Obsidian.md](http://Obsidian.md) Publish service. 

This [QUARTZ](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) solution is nice and has its charm, but Obsidian Publish is easier to handle regarding links and front-matter (related to my existing vault).

Starting a vault from scratch, I might revisit this solution.
