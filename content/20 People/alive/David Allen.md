[[You can do anything, but not everything.]]


[[You must use your mind to get things off your mind.]]


[[Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.]]


[[If you don't pay appropriate attention to what has your attention, it will take more of your attention than it deserves.]]


[[There is no reason to ever have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought.]]


[[Much of the stress that people feel doesn't come from having too much to do. It comes from not finishing what they've started.]]


[[The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small, manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one]]


[[If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging.]]


[[â€œSimple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behavior. Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple and stupid behavior.]]
